## Introduction
Welcome to the Rasa Chatbot Project! This project demonstrates how to build a conversational AI using the Rasa framework. The chatbot is designed to understand user inputs and respond accordingly based on predefined intents and entities.

### What is Rasa?
Rasa is an open-source machine learning framework that enables developers to build contextual chatbots and virtual assistants. It provides tools for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and dialogue management.

## Features
- **Intent Recognition**: Understand user intentions such as greetings, farewells, inquiries, and more.
- **Entity Extraction**: Identify specific pieces of information within user inputs (e.g., locations, dates).
- **Custom Actions**: Integrate external APIs or perform specific tasks based on user requests.
- **Interactive Learning**: Improve the chatbot over time with user interactions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Clone the Repository
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smuthupriyait/Rasachatbotproject.git

**Create a Virtual Environment**
Navigate into the project directory and create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies:
cd Rasachatbotproject
python -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
**
Install Dependencies**
Install the required packages listed in requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Usage**
Training the Model
Before using the chatbot, you need to train the model to understand intents and entities:
rasa train

**Running the Chatbot**
To start the Rasa server and interact with the bot:

Open a terminal and run:
rasa run
This starts the Rasa server.

Open a new terminal window and run:
rasa shell
This allows you to interact with the chatbot directly in the command line.

Running Custom Actions (if applicable)
If your chatbot uses custom actions, you need to start the action server:
rasa run actions

**Testing**
You can test the chatbot through the Rasa shell by typing messages. To validate the NLU performance, you can use the following command to check the predictions:
rasa shell nlu

**Common Commands**
Here are some common Rasa commands that you may find useful:

Train the Model: rasa train
Run the Rasa Server: rasa run
Run the Action Server: rasa run actions
Interact with the Bot: rasa shell
Validate NLU: rasa shell nlu
